## Updating versions

Process for updating all library versions::

1. Update Gradle version
    1. Find latest version and the checksum for -all version from https://gradle.org/release-checksums/
       (We use SHA to secure against wrapper attack, see https://blog.gradle.org/wrapper-attack-report)
    2. Run `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version VERSION --gradle-distribution-sha256-sum SHA`, where you
       substitute `VERSION` and `SHA` with the info found in the previous step.
2. Open `libs.toml` file and check if any versions marked with `@pin` have been unblocked and can now be updated
3. Run `./gradlew versionCatalogUpdate`.
4. Sync the project, build the app and run all tests to make sure everything still works.
5. Run `detektDebug` gradle task to find any new deprecated code
6. For any new deprecated code found by the search:
    * If the fix is trivial, fix it immediately as part of the update commit
    * Otherwise, make a tech debt ticket and add a @Suppress with the ticket number
      (and/or discuss with the team how to address it)

## Creating a new module

1. Copy module template from `config/templates` folder to root of the project and rename it to your module
2. If new module is an android library and if it needs android resources, add `buildFeatures { androidResources = true }`
   and namespace declaration to module's `build.gradle.kts`
3. Add module to `settings.gradle.kts`
4. Add module to app's `build.gradle.kts` as `implementation(projects.newModule)`)

## Hierarchy of the feature modules

Every feature should contain following modules:

* `feature-name`
    * `data` - data module with all non-UI logic (such as repositories).
      No other module (except for top level `app`) should depend on this.
    * `api` - interfaces and data models exposed to other modules.
      This module should generally contain no logic to speed up builds.
    * `ui` - Module containing feature's ui (Screens / Fragments / ViewModels)
    * `test` (optional) - Module containing test helpers for all other modules in this group

## Running integration tests

`./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest -PtestAppWithProguard`

# Creating screenshot tests

To create screenshot tests for your compose screen:

1. Make preview functions public
2. Add `showkase` plugin to the module of the screen you want to test
2. Add `@ShowkaseComposable(group = "Test")` annotation to the preview of the screen you want to test
3. run `recordPaparazziDebug` gradle task to record golden screenshot
   (double check that only previews for your screen were generated)
